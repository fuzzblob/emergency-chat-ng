# emergency-chat-ng

An attempt to revive an old emergency chat app for text communication during meltdowns and situational mutism.

The app aims to be a tool that people can carry with them and have available in an emergency. A single phone should suffice to have communication with someone in person.

## motivation

The reason I started working on this version of the app is that my phone is not compatible with the old 32bit only build available on sketchy mirrors like ApkPure. I wanted access to the app and was granted permission to take the source code and bring it to more modern versions of android.

## compatibility

Due to the use of AndroidX I have set the minimum and target Android API levels/SDK versions to 19 and 24 respectively. That translates to Android 4.4/Kitkat and Android 7/N. This excludes very old hardware/software but my focus is making this app accessible into the future.

I currently test with a Pixel 9a on Android 15/Level 35/VANILLA_ICE_CREAM as well as emulators for the minimal supported level.

## building

I am using the latest version of Android Studio. The project uses cradle 7.4 and JDK 11 to do builds. further instructions will be set up at a later point.

## origin and orther versions

An iOS version exists by Leonard Elezi ([iOS version of emergencychat on github](https://github.com/LeonardElezi/emergencychat) and on the [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/emergency-chat/id1024194363)).
